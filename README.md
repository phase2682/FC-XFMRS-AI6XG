For transformer loss measurements use xfrmr loss calcs.xslx
    This file has example data already loaded for transfomer loss measurements and load resistor characterization measurements.  Load in your own data using s2p file format (F S RI R) 

    
To calculate core loss from toroid and transfomer characteristics use ferrite calcs git.xlsx
  Toroid parameters for FT50-43, 2643625002, and FT240-43 already loaded for HF Ham Bands
  Input # of turns (N), # of cores, frequency
